botwot
======

botwot is a fun bot for the irc chat room.

It's for Python 2, some of the deps aren't yet on 3.

These things should be installed via pip:
* pyaib
* wolframalpha
* beautifulsoup4
* requests
* tldextract
* feedparser

Then copy the example config to botwot.conf and run it with `python2 botwot.py`.
